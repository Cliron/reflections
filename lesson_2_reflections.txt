we've opened with creating a new git repository with the command git init then we checked the status of the repository with the command git status

Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a hidden .git file (the git metadata file) is added to the directory and and you can togther with git begin to sort of monitoring the evolution of the repository

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area gives you as a programer more flexability in setting the project commits in a more logical formation, ie the staging area can help you diffrencite and bundle reletad commits.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

you can comepre the staging area to the working directory with the command diff --staged
you can also comepre the the staging area to the most resent commit with the git diff command that alows you to keep track on the changes you made to your codemor easily
